## Overview

### What is PeerTube ?
PeerTube is a federated (ActivityPub) video streaming platform using P2P (BitTorrent) directly in the web browser, using <a href="https://github.com/feross/webtorrent">WebTorrent</a>.

### Why PeerTube ?

We can't build a FOSS video streaming alternatives to YouTube, Dailymotion, Vimeo... with a centralized software. One organization alone cannot have enough money to pay bandwidth and video storage of its server.

So we need to have a decentralized network of servers seeding videos  (as [Hubzilla YunoHost](https://github.com/YunoHost-Apps/hubzilla_ynh), [Friendica YunoHost](https://github.com/YunoHost-Apps/friendica_ynh),[Mastodon YunoHost](https://github.com/YunoHost-Apps/mastodon_ynh)), [Diaspora](https://github.com/diaspora/diaspora) ([Diaspora YunoHost](https://github.com/YunoHost-Apps/diaspora_ynh)),[Funkwhale](https://funkwhale.audio) ([Funkwhale YunoHost](https://github.com/YunoHost-Apps/funkwhale_ynh))).
But it's not enough because one video could become famous and overload the server.
It's the reason why we need to use a P2P protocol to limit the server load.
Thanks to [WebTorrent](https://github.com/feross/webtorrent), we can make P2P (thus BitTorrent) inside the web browser, as of today.

### Why is that cool ?
Servers are run independently by different people and organizations. They can apply wildly different moderation policies, so you can find or make one that fits your taste perfectly.

By watching a video, you help the hosting provider to broadcast it by becoming a broadcaster of the video yourself. Each instance doesnâ€™t need much money to broadcast the videos of its users.

**Shipped version:** 2.3.0
