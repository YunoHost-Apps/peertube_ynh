## Disclaimers / important information

### Why PeerTube?

We can't build a FOSS video streaming alternatives to YouTube, Dailymotion, Vimeo... with a centralized software. One organization alone cannot have enough money to pay bandwidth and video storage of its server.

So we need to have a decentralized network of servers seeding videos  (as [Hubzilla YunoHost](https://github.com/YunoHost-Apps/hubzilla_ynh), [Friendica YunoHost](https://github.com/YunoHost-Apps/friendica_ynh),[Mastodon YunoHost](https://github.com/YunoHost-Apps/mastodon_ynh)), [Diaspora](https://github.com/diaspora/diaspora) ([Diaspora YunoHost](https://github.com/YunoHost-Apps/diaspora_ynh)),[Funkwhale](https://funkwhale.audio) ([Funkwhale YunoHost](https://github.com/YunoHost-Apps/funkwhale_ynh)).
But it's not enough because one video could become famous and overload the server.
It's the reason why we need to use a P2P protocol to limit the server load.
Thanks to [WebTorrent](https://github.com/feross/webtorrent), we can make P2P (thus BitTorrent) inside the web browser, as of today.

### Why is that cool?
Servers are run independently by different people and organizations. They can apply wildly different moderation policies, so you can find or make one that fits your taste perfectly.

By watching a video, you help the hosting provider to broadcast it by becoming a broadcaster of the video yourself. Each instance doesn't need much money to broadcast the videos of its users.

### IMPORTANT POINT TO READ BEFORE INSTALLING
